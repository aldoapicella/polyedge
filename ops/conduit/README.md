# Conduit host bundle

This is a rootful Podman/systemd bundle for the ARM64 `conduit-dev` host. It
uses immutable image digests, a private Podman network, a loopback-only
frontend, and Caddy as the sole public ingress. It has no Docker, Compose,
secrets, or automatic deployment.

## Hard gates

Do **not** start this stack or enable any timer until its exact Azure identity
and data scopes are assigned. The ring uploader supports the system-assigned
identity of an Azure Arc-enabled host, with no client secret. API, research,
and funded identities remain separate gates; a read SAS is not sufficient for
the writers or leases.

The API Quadlet persists its local recorder under `/srv/polyedge-ring`. Verify
that path is the 150-GB block-volume mount (not a directory on `/`) before every
start: `findmnt -T /srv/polyedge-ring && df -h /srv/polyedge-ring`.

Do **not** enable daily, replay, or qset shadow work on the boot disk. Their
working directories live under `/srv/polyedge-ring/jobs`; the runner refuses to
start with less than 40 GiB free. All Azure jobs remain disabled unless
`/etc/polyedge/ENABLE_AZURE_JOBS` exists, and their timers are not enabled by
the install sequence.

The legacy shadow schedule is intentionally absent. `shadow-qset` permits only
`campaign-2026-07-28-qset-v1` and remains disabled until manually approved.

## Install after both gates are approved

On Ubuntu/Debian, first verify the actual OS and packages, then install the
minimal runtime:

```sh
sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends podman caddy curl
sudo install -d -m 0750 /etc/polyedge/jobs /srv/polyedge-ring/jobs
sudo install -d -m 0700 /etc/polyedge/credentials/{api,research,shadow-qset}
sudo install -m 0644 ops/conduit/quadlets/* /etc/containers/systemd/
sudo install -m 0644 ops/conduit/systemd/* /etc/systemd/system/
sudo install -m 0755 ops/conduit/bin/polyedge-run-job /usr/local/libexec/
sudo install -m 0755 ops/conduit/bin/polyedge-ring-sync /usr/local/libexec/
sudo install -m 0755 ops/conduit/bin/polyedge-ring-health /usr/local/libexec/
sudo install -m 0755 ops/conduit/bin/polyedge-github-deploy /usr/local/libexec/
sudo install -m 0755 ops/conduit/bin/polyedge-quadlet-deploy /usr/local/sbin/
sudo install -m 0440 ops/conduit/sudoers/polyedge-deploy /etc/sudoers.d/
sudo install -m 0644 ops/conduit/journald/polyedge.conf /etc/systemd/journald.conf.d/
sudo install -m 0644 ops/conduit/caddy/Caddyfile /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
sudo install -m 0600 ops/conduit/env/api.env.example /etc/polyedge/api.env
sudo install -m 0600 ops/conduit/env/frontend.env.example /etc/polyedge/frontend.env
sudo install -m 0600 ops/conduit/env/funded-signer.env.example /etc/polyedge/funded-signer.env
sudo install -m 0600 ops/conduit/env/ring.env.example /etc/polyedge/ring.env
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart systemd-journald
```

The GitHub deploy key belongs to a locked `polyedge-deploy` account. Its only
authorized-key command is `/usr/local/libexec/polyedge-github-deploy` with the
`restrict` option. The wrapper and sudoers rule permit only digest-pinned API,
frontend, or funded-signer deployments through the validated Quadlet helper.

Replace each zero digest and every remaining `REPLACE_...` value in the
installed files, not in this repository. Provision the three API/frontend
Podman secrets named by their Quadlets before starting either service. Keep
API/frontend image digests in their Quadlets; set the same reviewed backend
digest in each enabled job env file. Configure Caddy with a real DNS name and
allow only SSH, TCP/80, and TCP/443 in OCI and the host firewall. Never expose
port 3000 or 8081.

`ring.env.example` starts with `POLYEDGE_RING_SEAL_ONLY=1`, so it can hash local
segments before Azure identity approval. Set it to `0` only after filling the
digest and either verifying the Arc identity's no-delete blob role or installing
the client-secret-file fallback.

For Arc, connect the host as `conduit-dev`, disable remote management features,
and assign `PolyEdge OCI Blob Writer` only at the `bot-events` container scope:

```sh
sudo azcmagent config set incomingconnections.enabled false
sudo azcmagent config set guestconfiguration.enabled false
sudo azcmagent config set extensions.enabled false
sudo azcmagent show
```

The uploader alone uses host networking to reach Arc's loopback identity
endpoint and mounts only `/var/opt/azcmagent/tokens` read-only. Other containers
remain on the private `polyedge` network.

External Azure client secrets, when approved, live only at
`/etc/polyedge/credentials/{api,research,shadow-qset}/azure-client-secret` with mode `0600`.
The containers receive those files read-only at `/run/credentials`; secret
values never belong in env files, Quadlets, Git, commands, or logs. Keep API
table access separate from the blob-only research/ring identity.

## Separate Entra identities

Arc unblocks the no-secret ring upload path. The API, research jobs, and funded
signer still use separate identities so the funded queue and wallet boundary is
never granted to the host-wide Arc identity. The operator does not need a
permanent directory role. An Entra administrator can create the three
applications and service principals, then add the operator as an application
owner. This step creates no credential:

```sh
operator_object_id=REPLACE_OPERATOR_OBJECT_ID
for name in polyedge-conduit-api polyedge-conduit-research polyedge-conduit-funded-signer; do
  app_id=$(az ad app create --display-name "$name" --sign-in-audience AzureADMyOrg --query appId -o tsv)
  az ad sp create --id "$app_id" --query id -o tsv
  az ad app owner add --id "$app_id" --owner-object-id "$operator_object_id"
done
```

After ownership propagates, the operator creates each credential directly into
its root-only host file and assigns only the documented container, table, or
queue scope. Do not send the credential through GitHub, chat, or shell history.

The funded signer is a separate, no-ingress, read-only container. Only it gets
the Podman wallet secrets and its dedicated Azure funded identity; the API and
research jobs get neither. It has no install target and remains disabled until
the funded identity, exact non-secret environment, origin check, queue repair,
and `FUNDED_EVIDENCE_TRUST_BOUNDARY_READY` review all pass. Root remains the
single-host trust ceiling and can administer both containers.

Primary research jobs share one serialized workspace so daily normalization,
replay, prospective validation, and backfills reuse local artifacts. The qset
workspace remains separate. The recorder writes one fsynced JSONL segment per
ten-minute UTC bucket. The
ring timer seals closed segments with SHA-256 manifests, creates immutable
Azure Cool-tier blobs without any remote listing, verifies retry collisions byte for
byte, and retains each local segment for 48 hours to leave job-workspace
headroom on the 150-GB volume. It removes a local segment only after its
immutable remote manifest is re-read successfully. A separate health timer
checks upload age and projected capacity and stops the API before free space
falls below 32 GiB.

After the approved authentication and separate-volume gates, create the marker
and enable only the intended timers:

```sh
sudo touch /etc/polyedge/ENABLE_AZURE_JOBS
sudo systemctl enable --now polyedge-api.service polyedge-frontend.service caddy.service
sudo systemctl enable --now polyedge-ring-sync.timer
sudo systemctl enable --now polyedge-ring-health.timer
sudo systemctl enable --now polyedge-freshness.timer polyedge-hourly.timer
# Enable daily/replay/qset individually only after their validation.
# sudo systemctl enable --now polyedge-daily.timer polyedge-replay.timer
# sudo systemctl enable --now polyedge-shadow-qset.timer
```

## Digest deployment

After the API/frontend are healthy, update one reviewed GHCR ARM64 digest at a
time. The helper accepts only these three units, updates only their installed
`Image=` line, makes a timestamped rollback copy, pulls and checks
`linux/arm64`, then restarts and verifies the running container's exact digest.
Any restart or verification failure restores the prior Quadlet and restarts it.

```sh
sudo /usr/local/sbin/polyedge-quadlet-deploy polyedge-api \
  ghcr.io/OWNER/polyedge-rust-backend@sha256:LOWERCASE_64_HEX_DIGEST
sudo /usr/local/sbin/polyedge-quadlet-deploy polyedge-frontend \
  ghcr.io/OWNER/polyedge-frontend@sha256:LOWERCASE_64_HEX_DIGEST
sudo /usr/local/sbin/polyedge-quadlet-deploy polyedge-funded-signer \
  ghcr.io/OWNER/polyedge-venue-probe@sha256:LOWERCASE_64_HEX_DIGEST
```

Rollback copies live in `/etc/polyedge/rollback/`. The helper never accepts a
tag, a non-GHCR registry, a mismatched image repository, or any unit other than
API, frontend, or funded signer.

Schedules are UTC: freshness every five minutes; hourly quality at `:10`;
primary daily at 00:30; replay at 03:00; qset shadow at 02:15. The runner uses
one `flock -w 36h /run/polyedge/research.lock`, so writers serialize even when
timers collide. It caps the daemons at 0.5 CPU / 1 GiB, daily/replay at 2 CPU /
4 GiB, and qset at 3 CPU / 8 GiB to reserve capacity on the 4-OCPU host.

## Verify, reboot, rollback

```sh
sudo systemd-analyze verify /etc/systemd/system/polyedge-job@.service
systemd-analyze calendar '*-*-* *:00/5:00 UTC' '*-*-* 00:30:00 UTC' '*-*-* 02:15:00 UTC'
systemctl list-timers 'polyedge-*'
podman ps --format '{{.Names}} {{.Status}}'
curl -fsS https://YOUR_DOMAIN/api/backend/health | jq -e '.ok and .execution_mode == "paper" and .kill_switch == false'
curl -fsS https://YOUR_DOMAIN/api/backend/status | jq -e '.task_health.api == "ok" and .task_health.runtime_loop == "running"'
journalctl -u polyedge-api.service -u polyedge-frontend.service -u caddy.service -b
sudo jq . /srv/polyedge-ring/status.json
```

For a no-data lock test:

```sh
sudo systemd-run --unit=polyedge-lock-a --collect /usr/bin/flock /run/polyedge/research.lock /bin/sleep 20
sudo systemd-run --unit=polyedge-lock-b --collect /usr/bin/flock /run/polyedge/research.lock /usr/bin/date
journalctl -u polyedge-lock-a -u polyedge-lock-b --since '1 minute ago'
```

Reboot only after health passes, then repeat the health, status, `podman ps`,
and `systemctl list-timers` checks. For rollback, restore the prior saved
`polyedge-api.container` and `polyedge-frontend.container` (both immutable
digests), run `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`, restart the two services, and
repeat the health checks. Retain the prior images until the rollback window
closes.
